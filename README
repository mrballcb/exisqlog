Exim SQL Log and Search

Description:
The core of this is a script which parses the exim log files fed to it and puts
the extracted data into a mysql database.  There is also a simple web interface
which allows you to search for that data on a per day basis (it stores the data
in a one day per table format).  Also included is a maintenance script to age
data out of the database by removing tables older than a configurable number of
days.

Assumptions:
1) Database backend is mysql.  It shouldn't be too hard to convert to use your
   favorite database with perl-DBI support.
2) MySQL sample commands in the script are for mysql 5.0 and older.  The
   syntax for CREATE USER and GRANT has changed for mysql 5.1 and newer.
3) RBL hits are logged in exim.conf with:
      message = $sender_host_address is listed at $dnslist_domain

Credits:
One of the main features of this process is the included "logtail" program.  It
is a perl script which starts reading a logfile at the last place that it
stopped and automatically finds the new file when it gets rotated.  Big thanks
to Jonathan Middleton and Paul Slootman for the Logcheck package which provided
this script.
