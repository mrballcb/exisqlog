Exim SQL Log and Search

Requirements:
1. Perl, DBI, and DBD::mysql.
2. Mysql database
3. Apache or whatever flavor of webserver you are familiar with.
4. Exim must be configured with:
   log_selector = +smtp_confirmation +return_path_on_delivery

Installation:
1. Put all of the script/* files in /usr/local/bin.  Make sure they are all
   executable.
2. Put this in the crontab for a user which can read the exim log files. I run
   it under user root, but you may wish to run it using a non-privileged user.
   On all exim mail servers:
     */2 * * * * /usr/local/bin/cron_log2sql.sh
3. Pick one of the servers to do a daily cleanup routine.  The crontab contents
   on this one master server will also need to include:
     @daily /usr/local/bin/cleansqlmainlog.pl --days=40
4. Put the contents of www/* into your webserver directory, including the
   .htaccess file in www/_private/.  A typical install base is /var/www/html,
   and I typically use /var/www/html/maillog for my installation.  You may have
   to do additional configuration to your webserver to make it access the
   pages, but I know on a CentOS 5.x installation, it just works.
5. I suggest at least a basic authentication setup using .htaccess to prevent
   just anybody accessing this page, including co-workers.  In my humble
   opinion, it should be used only on an internal webserver, but if you must put
   it on a public facing webserver, don't leave access wide open.  Google for
   "htaccess apache" if you do not know how to do this.
6. Point your browser to http://yourserver/maillog and load the page.

Comments:
Exim is a very configurable system, so some parts of my configuration and
operation may exhibit different characteristics.  For example, my system doesn't
reject a connection using RBL's until the RCPT phase.  Why?  Because then I know
both who it's from and who it was attempted to be delivered to, and can log both
of them.  Also any email that's rejected before the DATA phase does not have a
mail queue id, so I generate a fake id by combining the date, time, and server
name.

Bugs:
I know it's not perfect, so if you find any bugs, let me know about it!  Email
me at tlyons@ivenue.com and I'll see about fixing it up.  If it's not parsing
your logfile properly and extracting the info you think it should, include in
your email the logfile lines (not obfuscated, I need to see real data) and what
you think it should be extracting.
